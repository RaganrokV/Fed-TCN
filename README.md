## This is the code of Fed-TCN and baselines for ULTRA multi-step air pollutant forecasting.
1.Since we are not experts in the field of computer science, we shamefully admit that there is a lot of redundancy and unjustified naming in the code.

2.We didn't use sophisticated function calls, so in theory you could just swap out the data for a local pollutant dataset and run.
